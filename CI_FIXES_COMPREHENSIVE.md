# Comprehensive CI Fixes for OpenNext.js

## Summary

This PR fixes ALL CI issues to make the GitHub Actions pipeline fully functional for the OpenNext.js fork. All changes preserve functionality while removing dependencies on Vercel-specific infrastructure.

## Changes Made

### 1. Turbo Remote Cache Disabled

**Files Modified:**

- `.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml`
- `.github/workflows/build_reusable.yml`
- `.github/workflows/build_and_deploy.yml`

**Changes:**

```yaml
# Before:
TURBO_TEAM: 'vercel'
TURBO_CACHE: 'remote:rw'

# After:
# TURBO_TEAM: 'vercel'  # Commented out
# TURBO_CACHE: 'remote:rw'  # Commented out
TURBO_CACHE: 'local'  # Use local cache only
```

**Rationale:** Remote cache requires Vercel infrastructure access. Local cache still provides performance benefits without external dependencies.

### 2. DataDog Monitoring Disabled

**Files Modified:**

- `.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml`
- `.github/workflows/build_reusable.yml`
- `.github/workflows/test_e2e_deploy_release.yml`

**Changes:**

```yaml
# Environment variables commented out:
# DATADOG_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.DATA_DOG_API_KEY }}
# NEXT_JUNIT_TEST_REPORT: 'true'
# DD_ENV: 'ci'
# TEST_TIMINGS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TEST_TIMINGS_TOKEN }}

# Upload step commented out in build_reusable.yml
```

**Rationale:** DataDog is a paid monitoring service. Test results are still available in GitHub Actions UI.

### 3. Vercel Platform Tests Disabled

**Files Modified:**

- `.github/workflows/build_reusable.yml`
- `.github/workflows/test_e2e_deploy_release.yml`

**Changes:**

```yaml
# Environment variables commented out:
# VERCEL_TEST_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TEST_TOKEN }}
# VERCEL_TEST_TEAM: vtest314-next-e2e-tests
```

**Rationale:** These test deployment to Vercel's platform. OpenNext.js is self-hosted only and explicitly doesn't support Vercel deployment.

### 4. Timeout Limits Added

**Files Modified:**

- `.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml`

**Changes:**

```yaml
build-native:
  timeout_minutes: 60 # Added
build-native-windows:
  timeout_minutes: 60 # Added
build-next:
  timeout_minutes: 45 # Added
```

**Rationale:** Prevents jobs from hanging indefinitely (18+ hours) due to network timeouts or missing infrastructure.

### 5. GitHub API Permissions Fixed

**Files Modified:**

- `.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml`

**Changes:**

```yaml
validate-docs-links:
  permissions:
    contents: read
    checks: write # Added
    pull-requests: write # Added
```

**Rationale:** Script needs permissions to create GitHub checks and PR comments. Without these, fails with "Resource not accessible by integration".

## Impact Analysis

### ‚úÖ What Still Works

- All core Next.js functionality tests
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Build processes
- Linting and type checking
- Documentation validation
- Local Turbo cache for performance

### ‚ùå What's Disabled (Intentionally)

- Vercel platform deployment tests (not needed for self-hosted)
- DataDog monitoring (paid service)
- Remote Turbo cache (Vercel infrastructure)
- Test timing analytics (requires DataDog)

### üéØ Result

- No more hanging jobs
- No more permission errors
- Clean CI runs that complete in reasonable time
- All tests relevant to self-hosted deployments still run

## Testing

All changes have been tested to ensure:

1. Jobs complete within timeout limits
2. No "Resource not accessible" errors
3. Core functionality remains intact
4. CI provides useful feedback on PRs

## Philosophy Alignment

These changes align with OpenNext.js principles:

- **Self-hosted focused** - Removes platform-specific dependencies
- **No vendor lock-in** - Eliminates Vercel-specific infrastructure
- **Framework defines capabilities** - Not limited by platform constraints
